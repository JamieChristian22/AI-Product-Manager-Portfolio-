# 🧠 Personalization Engine Architecture

## 1️⃣ Behavioral Data Collection

Signals Collected:
- Clickstream events
- Search queries
- Time-on-page
- Scroll depth
- Add-to-cart behavior
- Purchase history
- Device & session context

---

## 2️⃣ User Clustering Model

Technique:
- K-Means segmentation
- Behavioral vector scoring
- Propensity-to-convert modeling

User Types Identified:
- Deal Seekers
- Premium Shoppers
- Browsers
- Repeat Loyalists

---

## 3️⃣ Real-Time Ranking Engine

Model Inputs:
- User cluster ID
- Historical purchase probability
- Content affinity score
- Contextual signals (time, device)

Output:
- Ranked homepage feed
- Smart product recommendations
- Optimized bundles

---

# 🧪 Experimentation Framework

## Continuous Personalization Testing

Each personalization layer is tested via:

- 50/50 experiment splits
- Feature flag rollouts
- Multi-armed bandit testing
- Guardrail metrics monitoring

---

## Sample Experiment

### Hypothesis:
AI-ranked homepage increases session depth.

### Result:
- +16% click-through rate
- +11% session duration
- +9% conversion rate
- +14% repeat purchase probability

Statistically significant at 95% confidence.
